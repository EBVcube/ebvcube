#' Easy access of EVB NetCDFs
#'
#' @description This package can be used to easily access the data of the EBV
#'   NetCDFs which can be downloaded from the \href{portal.geobon.org}{Geobon
#'   Portal}. It also provides some basic visualization of the data.  Advanced
#'   users can build their own NetCDFs with the EBV standard using this package.
#'
#' @details This package contains three main usecases: accessing the data and
#'   visualising the data from the portal and creating your own data in the EBV
#'   NetCDF standard. All function have a corresponding naming pattern:
#'   ebv_data_ for data reading, ebv_plot_ for visualisation and ebv_netcdf_ for
#'   creating a NetCDF.
